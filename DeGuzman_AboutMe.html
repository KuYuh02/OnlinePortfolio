                <p style="margin-left: 40px">My name is Martin Angelo DeGuzman. I live in Dublin California and I am currently a Sophomore at Las Positas College with a major in Computer Science. I plan to transfer to a four-year UC in Fall 2023. I fell in love with computer science ever since I took an introduction class in high school. I started by making basic websites and games, but quickly learned how dynamic and practical the field was in college. I am excited about anything when it comes to coding, and plan to make several projects in the future with what I have learned so far. Being a first generation as well as first to work on a degree in my family is a big but exciting challenge.</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px">After a couple years since the quarantine, I have learned to be organized, independent, and resourceful. Online learning was a very different experience, but I'm glad it happened. It was very difficult converting from high school student to full time college student in the beginning. I was confused, alone, and stressed out from my environment. Luckily, after many conversations with older siblings, adults, counselours, professors, and employers, I think I have it mostly figured out. It just took changing my student education plan six times haha. Nonetheless, the quarantine shed light on my great strengths stated above, and forced me to improve my greatest weaknesses such as hesitating when asking for help. </p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px">Other than school and work, my hobbies include: learning and researching news about AI and Machine Learning, and learning a new coding language, and spending time with my friends and family. One of my favorite pass times with friends and families is watching movies and playing party games. I personally love classical japanese movies and anime, and I also love playing card games like Bang. Another thing I have learned over the quarantine is the importance of breaks. My hobbies are the main ways I relieve stress and prevent burnout. Nonetheless, thank you for spending the time to read my about me page. If you wish to learn more, you can see all the projects I have done in my high school career or you can find my email at the contact me section.</p>
