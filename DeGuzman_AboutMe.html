                <p style="margin-left: 40px">My name is Martin Angelo DeGuzman. I live in Dublin California and I recently graduated from Dublin High school and am currently as a Freshmen at Las Positas College. At Dublin High, excelled in the classes Computer Science Principles, Introduction to Engineering class, and Video Game Design. A common factor I have noticed is my passion for technology and computers in general. The classes puts my skills to the test as there is many hands-on activities necessary to pass. My main focus is to become either a computer scientist or video game designer. Being in college now, I realize how much hard work and persistence needed in order for this dream to come true. That is why I am confident that my completed experience and academic achievements will be able to take me to places of success and happiness.</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px">From balancing my life, school, work, and social life, I have learned how to be independent, organized, and resourceful. I took a decent amount of advanced classes, did cross country and track and field during Freshman and Sophomore year, as well as worked at Baskin Robbins my Senior year. Track and Field ultimately taught me the importance of teamwork and how collaboration can and will lead to a better final product, in this case, a better race time. I think a big part of my success during the season was that I learned how to fail, train, and do better. I was very out of shape in the beginning, but after just one season, I managed to shave off almost one minute off of my mile time. Next, Baskin Robbins brought me into the workforce and helped me set financial goals for the future. Both of these extracurricular activities needed me to manage my time wisely, which has really helped the present me.</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px">Striving to become a computer scientist means that I have hobbies similar to that category including building computers, repairing computers, and learning code for fun, and much more. Of course, I do not just do educational stuff, the Computer I built was for gaming, which is one of my favorite hobbies as well. Some of my favorite games at the moment include Overwatch, League of Legends, Rainbow Six Siege, and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. In the games, it is not only very fun and entertaining, I have learned tactics and the importance of communication of a team to achieve a common goal; a good skill to have in the workforce. Fun fact, I wrote an <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IHlXS9x3Ej3nDY484t66fs6zBqdoXjMeto0qZI1FSk4/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">essay</a> on the benefits of playing video games back in Freshman Year. What I am trying to say is that part of being a computer scientist to me is to have fun while doing something you love ultimately, and I believe these extracurricular activities will also help me achieve that goal. During the quarantine of 2020, I mostly spent my time practicing my and refreshing my coding skills, planned out my schedule for the upcoming school year, and reading books for fun. Nonetheless, thank you for spending the time to read my about me page.
