                <p>For the Toy Train Project, I created the Engine with a packet of <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vk-CwY0T8OQAorgz-wy4lrBP-WSPewSnsRp52mx9q5c/edit" target="_blank">instructions</a> which contained all the dimensions needed to create and assemble all of the parts of the train engine in AutoDesk Inventor. After that, I was put into a team and asked to follow another set of <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qpFgU3w6ImNDcrbw3s85s2JiC2MYjjzi5DCE4sKlXes/edit" target="_blank">instructions.</a> This would essentially be an online or downloadable software for children. After creating the train, we wouldâ€™ve had to present a <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QzVxG-3u95eX9PDachqV1Vb7zNRyfds9miIlzZ7Luqs/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">brief presentation</a> which would include, all of our train cars, the whole <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8pwJBU92bZJaTJzUDZ5SC1SRG8/view" target="_blank">train driving</a>, and some slides with explanations and commentary to be presentable and sellable. Our train theme was based on space vehicles as my group though it would be unique and fun to design. For the first train car, we decided to make a rocket car which would essentially be the engine car of the train. Next, we made a space shuttle which was the biggest out of all the train cars. Then, we have the space rover, with which had rotating eye cameras. Lastly, we made the space Satellite with rotating solar panels for added effect and realisticity. I had a lot of fun with this project as it taught me how to add a rotating feature to a part or assembly,how to drive multiple vehicles at once, as well as advanced modeling in inventor. I think I did pretty good considering that I followed the criteria on the rubric. Winners train. Losers complain.</p></br></br>

                  Type of Project: Individual using Autodesk Maya</br></br>
                  This project was another of the big tests to test our skills in Autodesk Maya. </br></br>
                  Since we were also only given an image, we had to be creative in how we would best recreate this wagon. After reviewing my notes and recollecting my thoughts, I began to start and finish the project in about a week and a half. Ultimately, it was very fun as well because it gave me confidence in that I can now recreate semi difficult object from real life into Maya, and that I can maybe apply it in my job later on in the future as a potential video game designer and if not, it is still pretty cool to have this fun pass time up my sleeve.</p> </br> </br>

                  This project was used to show what we have learned in the first semester of Video Game and Design, and test whether we can apply it successfully. In the beginning, it seemed like a difficult challenge for me, so I first reviewed our notes on google classroom. Then I started brainstorming what kind of techniques and processes I can use to help build the controller with ease and speed, because we were on a time constraint to only working on the project in class. This was because Autodesk Maya needed an education license from the school in order to download, so I could not work on it at home. By working on each side one by one, I eventually completed it 3 days before the due date. Ultimately, the project was very fun and challenging, as it focused more on individual skill and knowledge. It also reinforced the lesson to meet individual due dates and to plan out your project in order to not overwhelm yourself by spreading out the work and managing your time more efficiently. </p> </br>

                  This was one of the first projects we did in Computer Science Priniciples. This is because it is very beginner friendly, while also having intermediate protocols such as algorithms. At first, we brainstromed many ideas for potential games and stories. Then we decided to do a multiplayer maze race. We then coded together in class and at home. We had a gallery walk to get feedback. And used that to finish off the project. This project was very fun because we had so much creative freedom, yet difficult because Coding was new to us at the same time. Overall, the project reinforced the ideas to set and meet deadlines, as well as emphasized the importance of using feedback and cooperation to ultimately have a higher quality end product. </p> </br>
